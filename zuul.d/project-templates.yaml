    description: |
      This template runs no jobs, it is needed if a project does not use
      any single job so that changes can get merged.

      Do not use this with projects that have jobs defined in the gate
      pipeline.
    check:
      jobs:
        - noop
    gate:
      jobs:
        - noop
